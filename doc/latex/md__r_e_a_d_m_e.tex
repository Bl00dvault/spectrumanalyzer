This program is a simple spectrum analyzer that displays a bar graph of the amplitude of different frequency bands. It is built using Python, with the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and matplotlib for the visualization.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
To use the program, simply run the script spectrum\+\_\+analyzer.\+py. A window will appear showing a bar graph of the amplitude of different frequency bands. You can adjust the amplitude of any of the visible bands by selecting it and moving the corresponding slider in the \char`\"{}\+Options\char`\"{} window. You can select one of the four visible bands using the corresponding button.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
